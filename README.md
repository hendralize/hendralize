## Hello!

I'm Hendra, a teenager who is interested in program code.

## Little info about me

I live in Bali, Indonesia. Love code since in forth grade of elementary school, I made some script with `bash` as language, such as Android tweak, Covid-19 Data Fetcher, etc. However those scripts were in my old account, and was deleted.
